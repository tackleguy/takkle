    content: `Name, Image, and Likeness (NIL) has transformed the landscape of student athletics. What started as a college-level movement has now expanded to high school sports, giving younger athletes the chance to monetize their personal brand while still in school. But navigating NIL as a high school athlete — or as a parent — can be overwhelming.

This guide breaks down the entire process, step by step, so you can go from zero NIL deals to your first signed contract.

## What Is NIL and Why Does It Matter?

NIL stands for Name, Image, and Likeness. It refers to an athlete's right to earn money from their personal brand — their name, their face, their reputation. This can include social media sponsorships, product endorsements, paid appearances, autograph signings, and much more.

Before NIL rules changed, student-athletes at every level were prohibited from earning money related to their athletic status. The fear was that it would "professionalize" amateur sports. But the reality is that athletes generate enormous value — and the movement to let them benefit from it has gained momentum across the country.

For high school athletes, NIL isn't just about making money today. It's about learning valuable skills in entrepreneurship, marketing, and personal finance. It's about building a brand that will serve them through college and beyond.

## Step 1: Check Your State's Rules

Before pursuing any NIL opportunity, the first and most important step is understanding what your state allows. NIL rules vary dramatically from state to state — some fully permit it, others prohibit it entirely, and many fall somewhere in between.

Use the [Takkle NIL Rules Checker](/) to instantly see your state's status. Key things to verify include whether your state permits NIL at all, what specific restrictions apply, whether your athletic association requires disclosure, and any age-related restrictions.

If your state prohibits NIL, don't despair. You can still build your brand, grow your audience, and prepare for NIL opportunities in college.

## Step 2: Build Your Personal Brand

Your personal brand is the foundation of all NIL opportunities. It's what makes brands want to work with you. Here's how to build one.

**Define your identity.** What makes you unique beyond your sport? Maybe you're a great student, a community volunteer, or have an interesting hobby. The best personal brands showcase the whole person, not just the athlete.

**Create a consistent image.** Use the same profile photo, handle, and bio across all platforms. This makes you recognizable and professional.

**Tell your story.** People connect with stories more than statistics. Share your journey — the early morning practices, the setbacks, the victories. Authenticity resonates with both fans and brands.

**Be professional.** Everything you post online is part of your brand. Avoid controversial content, inappropriate language, or anything that could turn off potential sponsors. Remember that brands do their research before partnering with athletes.

## Step 3: Grow Your Social Media

Social media is the primary vehicle for high school NIL deals. Brands look at your following, engagement rate, and content quality when evaluating potential partnerships.

**Choose your platforms wisely.** You don't need to be everywhere. Focus on 1-2 platforms where your audience is most active. For most high school athletes, Instagram and TikTok are the most valuable platforms for NIL.

**Post consistently.** Aim for at least 3-5 posts per week. Consistency is more important than perfection. Use a mix of training content, game highlights, personal moments, and lifestyle content.

**Engage with your audience.** Reply to comments, respond to DMs, and interact with other accounts. Engagement rate often matters more to brands than raw follower count.

**Use hashtags strategically.** Research relevant hashtags in your sport and location. Local hashtags can help you connect with local businesses that might want to sponsor you.

**Collaborate with other athletes.** Cross-promotion with teammates or athletes in other sports can help you reach new audiences.

## Step 4: Find NIL Opportunities

Once you have a brand and an audience, it's time to find deals. There are several avenues to explore.

**NIL marketplaces.** Platforms like INFLCR, Opendorse, and Icon Source connect athletes with brands. Create profiles on these platforms and keep them updated.

**Local businesses.** Don't overlook local opportunities. Restaurants, gyms, car dealerships, and other local businesses are often eager to partner with popular high school athletes. Reach out directly with a professional pitch.

**Social media outreach.** DM or email brands you genuinely use and love. Authentic partnerships perform better for both parties. Include your media kit with your follower count, engagement rate, demographics, and content examples.

**Youth sports camps and clinics.** If you're skilled enough, hosting or co-hosting sports camps can be a lucrative NIL activity. Parents pay for their kids to learn from talented athletes.

**Content creation.** Start a YouTube channel, podcast, or blog. Once you have an audience, you can monetize through ads, sponsorships, or paid content.

## Step 5: Evaluate and Negotiate Deals

Not all NIL deals are created equal. Here's how to evaluate opportunities.

**Understand the terms.** What exactly are you agreeing to do? How many posts, appearances, or deliverables are required? What's the timeline? Make sure you understand every obligation.

**Know your value.** Research what other athletes with similar followings and engagement are earning. Don't undervalue yourself, but also be realistic about your reach.

**Watch for red flags.** Be wary of deals that require exclusive rights to your likeness, have extremely long terms, include vague performance requirements, or ask you to promote products you wouldn't use. Check our guide on [Red Flags in NIL Contracts](/guides/red-flags-nil-contracts) for a complete checklist.

**Get it in writing.** Every NIL deal should have a written contract. Never rely on verbal agreements. If a brand isn't willing to put terms in writing, walk away.

**Have a parent or attorney review.** For athletes under 18, parental involvement isn't just recommended — it's usually required. For significant deals, having an attorney review the contract is well worth the investment.

## Step 6: Sign the Deal

Once you've evaluated the deal and are comfortable with the terms, it's time to sign.

**Read the contract one more time.** Before signing, read every word of the contract again. Make sure there are no changes from what was discussed.

**Keep copies of everything.** Save a copy of the signed contract, all email communications, and any related documents. You'll need these for tax purposes and compliance.

**Set calendar reminders.** Note all deadlines for deliverables, payment schedules, and contract end dates. Missing a deadline can create problems.

**Fulfill your obligations.** Once you sign, treat it like a professional commitment. Deliver quality content on time and communicate proactively if issues arise.

## Step 7: Manage Your NIL Business

NIL income creates real financial and legal responsibilities.

**Track all income.** Keep detailed records of every payment you receive. This includes cash, products, services, and gift cards — they're all taxable.

**Understand your tax obligations.** NIL income is typically classified as self-employment income. You may need to make quarterly estimated tax payments. Read our [NIL Taxes for Minors guide](/guides/nil-taxes-for-minors) for details.

**Open a separate bank account.** Keep your NIL income separate from personal money. This makes bookkeeping and tax filing much easier.

**Consider an LLC.** As your NIL business grows, forming an LLC can provide liability protection and tax benefits. Consult with a business attorney and accountant.

**Maintain compliance.** Keep your athletic association informed if required, and make sure all your NIL activities comply with your state's rules.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

**Ignoring your state's rules.** This is the biggest mistake. Engaging in NIL activity in a state that prohibits it can cost you your eligibility.

**Choosing money over fit.** Don't promote a product you don't believe in just for the paycheck. Your audience will see through it, and it damages your brand long-term.

**Neglecting academics.** Your education is more important than any NIL deal. If NIL activities are hurting your grades, it's time to scale back.

**Not keeping records.** Poor record-keeping creates tax problems and compliance issues. Be organized from day one.

**Going it alone.** Involve your parents, coaches, and potentially professional advisors. NIL is complex, and you don't have to figure it all out yourself.

## Conclusion

Getting NIL deals as a high school athlete is an exciting opportunity, but it requires preparation, professionalism, and patience. Start by understanding your state's rules, build an authentic personal brand, grow your audience, and approach deals with a business mindset.

Remember that NIL is a marathon, not a sprint. The brand you build in high school will follow you to college and beyond. Invest in doing it right.

    content: `Your high school athlete just signed their first NIL deal. Congratulations! But before the celebration goes too far, there's an important topic that many families overlook: taxes. NIL income is fully taxable, and understanding your obligations from the start can prevent headaches — and penalties — down the road.

This guide covers everything parents need to know about NIL taxes for minor athletes.

## Is NIL Income Taxable?

Yes, absolutely. All NIL income is taxable by the IRS, regardless of the athlete's age. Whether your 15-year-old earns $200 from a local sponsorship or your 17-year-old earns $20,000 from a major brand deal, that income must be reported.

Many parents are surprised to learn that their child's NIL income doesn't fall under the "kiddie tax" rules that apply to unearned income (like investment returns). NIL income is considered earned income — specifically, self-employment income. This distinction matters because it affects how the income is taxed and what deductions are available.

The IRS treats NIL athletes as independent contractors, not employees. This means no taxes are withheld from payments, and the athlete (or their parent) is responsible for reporting all income and paying the applicable taxes.

## Types of NIL Income

Understanding what counts as NIL income is essential for proper tax reporting. Here are the most common types:

**Cash payments** from sponsorships, endorsements, appearances, and autograph signings are the most straightforward. These are clearly taxable income.

**Products and merchandise** received in exchange for promotion are also taxable. The fair market value of any products you receive must be reported as income. If a company sends your athlete $500 worth of gear to promote, that's $500 in taxable income.

**Gift cards** are treated the same as cash and must be reported at face value.

**Services** received as compensation — like free training, tutoring, or access to facilities — are also taxable at their fair market value.

**Trips and experiences** paid for by a brand as part of an NIL deal have taxable value and should be reported.

The key rule is simple: if your athlete received anything of value in exchange for their NIL, it's likely taxable.

## Self-Employment Tax Explained

As an independent contractor, your athlete's NIL income is subject to self-employment tax in addition to regular income tax. Self-employment tax covers Social Security (12.4%) and Medicare (2.9%) contributions, for a combined rate of 15.3%.

When you work as an employee, your employer pays half of these taxes. But as a self-employed NIL athlete, your athlete is responsible for the full amount.

Here's a simplified example. If your athlete earns $10,000 in NIL income, they would owe approximately $1,530 in self-employment tax alone, before any regular income tax. The good news is that half of the self-employment tax (about $765) can be deducted from adjusted gross income.

Self-employment tax applies once net self-employment earnings exceed $400 in a tax year. So even relatively small NIL earnings can trigger this obligation.

## Deductions and Write-Offs

The good news is that legitimate business expenses related to NIL activity can reduce your taxable income. Common deductions include:

**Agent or manager fees.** If your athlete pays a percentage to an agent, manager, or NIL platform, those fees are deductible.

**Marketing and promotion costs.** Expenses for creating content, building a website, printing business cards, or running social media ads can be deducted.

**Equipment for content creation.** Cameras, lighting, microphones, editing software, and similar equipment used for NIL content are deductible.

**Travel expenses.** If your athlete travels specifically for NIL-related activities (appearances, photoshoots, meetings), those travel costs may be deductible. Keep in mind that commuting to practice or games is not an NIL deduction.

**Professional services.** Fees paid to attorneys, accountants, or tax professionals for NIL-related work are deductible.

**Home office deduction.** If your athlete uses a dedicated space in your home exclusively for NIL business activities, a portion of household expenses may be deductible. This can be complex, so consult a tax professional.

Important: Only expenses that are directly related to NIL business activity are deductible. Athletic equipment, gym memberships, and training costs used for your sport are generally not deductible as NIL business expenses — they're personal athletic expenses.

## Quarterly Estimated Tax Payments

If your athlete expects to owe $1,000 or more in taxes for the year, the IRS requires quarterly estimated tax payments. These are due on April 15, June 15, September 15, and January 15 of the following year.

Failing to make quarterly payments can result in underpayment penalties, even if you pay the full amount at tax time. The penalties aren't huge, but they're easily avoidable with proper planning.

To calculate quarterly payments, estimate your athlete's total NIL income for the year, subtract estimated deductions, apply the self-employment tax rate and applicable income tax rate, and divide by four.

Many families find it simplest to set aside 25-30% of each NIL payment received into a separate savings account dedicated to taxes. This ensures the money is available when quarterly payments are due.

## Filing Requirements for Minors

Minor athletes (under 18) can and must file their own tax return if their income exceeds the filing threshold. For the 2025 tax year, a single filer must file if their earned income exceeds $14,600 (this threshold may change for 2026).

However, even if income is below this threshold, filing is required if self-employment income exceeds $400 (to pay self-employment tax).

Key points for filing as a minor:

**The return is filed in the athlete's name** using their Social Security number, not the parent's.

**Parents may still claim the athlete as a dependent** on their own return, even if the athlete files separately. The athlete just can't claim their own exemption.

**Form 1099-NEC or 1099-MISC** should be issued by any company that pays the athlete $600 or more. But all income must be reported, even without a 1099.

**Schedule SE** is used to calculate and report self-employment tax.

**Schedule C** is used to report business income and expenses from NIL activity.

## Record-Keeping Best Practices

Good record-keeping is essential for tax compliance and maximizing deductions. Here's what to track:

**All income received.** Keep a log of every payment, including date, amount, payer, and type (cash, product, service). Screenshot or save confirmation emails and payment receipts.

**All expenses.** Save receipts for every NIL-related expense. Use an app or spreadsheet to categorize expenses by type.

**Contracts and agreements.** Keep copies of all NIL contracts and correspondence.

**1099 forms.** Collect all 1099 forms received from brands and platforms.

**Mileage log.** If your athlete drives to NIL-related events, keep a mileage log. There are free apps that can track this automatically.

Consider using a simple bookkeeping app or spreadsheet to track income and expenses throughout the year. Waiting until tax season to gather everything creates unnecessary stress and increases the chance of errors.

## When to Hire a Tax Professional

While small amounts of NIL income might be manageable on your own, hiring a tax professional is recommended if:

Your athlete earns more than a few thousand dollars in NIL income, you're unsure about deductions or self-employment tax, your athlete has NIL income from multiple states, you want to explore forming an LLC or other business entity, or the IRS contacts you about your athlete's return.

A CPA or tax professional who understands self-employment income can save you money in the long run through proper deductions and planning. Look for someone familiar with athlete income or influencer/creator taxes.

## State Tax Considerations

In addition to federal taxes, NIL income may also be subject to state income tax. Most states tax all earned income, including NIL income.

If your athlete earns NIL income in a state other than your home state (for example, at an out-of-state appearance), that income may be taxable in both states, with a credit for taxes paid to the other state.

Some states have no income tax at all (Alaska, Florida, Nevada, New Hampshire, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Washington, and Wyoming), which simplifies things for athletes in those states.

Use the [Takkle NIL Rules Checker](/) to see your state's NIL rules, and consult a tax professional about your state's specific tax requirements.

## Conclusion

NIL taxes don't have to be scary, but they do require attention. The key principles are simple: report all income, keep good records, make quarterly payments if needed, and get professional help when warranted.

By staying on top of your athlete's tax obligations from the beginning, you'll avoid penalties, maximize deductions, and teach your athlete valuable financial responsibility skills that will serve them well beyond their athletic career.`,

    content: `Your high school athlete has been offered an NIL deal. It's exciting — a brand wants to pay them for being themselves. But before anyone signs on the dotted line, the contract needs a careful review. NIL contracts can contain clauses that seem harmless on the surface but can cause serious problems for young athletes.

This guide walks parents through the most common red flags in NIL contracts and what to do when you spot them.

## Why Contract Review Matters

An NIL contract is a legally binding agreement. Once signed, your athlete is obligated to fulfill its terms — and the company has rights that may be difficult to undo. For minor athletes, the stakes are even higher because minors may not fully understand the implications of what they're agreeing to.

The best defense is a thorough review before signing. Every contract should be read in full, ideally by both a parent and a qualified attorney. Don't let excitement override due diligence.

Many NIL contracts are written by the brand's attorneys, which means they're designed to protect the brand's interests — not your athlete's. That's not inherently bad, but it means you need to be your athlete's advocate.

## Red Flag #1: Excessive Exclusivity

**What it looks like:** "Athlete agrees not to promote, endorse, or associate with any competing brand, product, or service in the [category] space during the term of this agreement and for 12 months after termination."

**Why it's a problem:** Exclusivity clauses prevent your athlete from working with other brands in the same category. A broad exclusivity clause in a sports drink deal could prevent your athlete from working with any beverage company — potentially costing them larger deals in the future.

**What to do:** Negotiate exclusivity as narrowly as possible. Limit it to direct competitors (not entire categories), and ensure the exclusivity period doesn't extend beyond the contract term. If a brand demands exclusivity, the compensation should reflect the opportunity cost.

## Red Flag #2: Broad IP Rights Transfers

**What it looks like:** "Athlete grants Company the perpetual, irrevocable, worldwide, royalty-free license to use Athlete's name, image, likeness, voice, and biographical information in any media, now known or hereafter devised."

**Why it's a problem:** This gives the company the right to use your athlete's image forever, anywhere, for any purpose — without any additional payment. They could use it in ads for years after the contract ends, sell it to other companies, or use it in ways your athlete never intended.

**What to do:** Ensure image rights are limited to the contract term, specific uses described in the contract, and approved content only. Your athlete should retain ownership of their NIL and only license it for specific, defined purposes.

## Red Flag #3: Vague Deliverables

**What it looks like:** "Athlete will create content and promote Company's products as reasonably requested by Company."

**Why it's a problem:** Without specific deliverables, the company could ask for unlimited content, appearances, or promotional activities. Your athlete might end up doing far more work than they expected for the agreed compensation.

**What to do:** Insist on specific, numbered deliverables. For example: "3 Instagram posts, 2 TikTok videos, and 1 in-person appearance per month." Include content approval rights so your athlete can review and approve all content before it goes live.

## Red Flag #4: No Termination Clause

**What it looks like:** A contract that has no provision for either party to end the agreement early.

**Why it's a problem:** Circumstances change. Your athlete might get injured, the brand might become controversial, or the relationship simply might not work out. Without a termination clause, your athlete could be locked into an unfavorable agreement with no way out.

**What to do:** Ensure the contract includes termination rights for both parties with reasonable notice (30-60 days is standard). Also look for "cause" termination provisions that allow immediate exit if either party breaches the agreement.

## Red Flag #5: Performance-Based Pay

**What it looks like:** "Athlete will receive a $500 bonus for each game in which Athlete scores a touchdown / wins MVP / leads the team in scoring."

**Why it's a problem:** Performance-based bonuses tied to athletic outcomes are prohibited in virtually every state that allows high school NIL. These clauses can jeopardize your athlete's eligibility. They're also problematic because they start to blur the line between NIL compensation and pay-for-play.

**What to do:** Remove any performance-based compensation. NIL payments should be based on the promotional activities performed (posts, appearances, etc.), not athletic performance.

## Red Flag #6: School Branding Requirements

**What it looks like:** "Athlete will wear school uniform / jersey in all promotional content" or "Content must reference Athlete's team and school."

**Why it's a problem:** Using school logos, uniforms, mascots, or branding in NIL deals is prohibited in nearly every state. A contract that requires it is asking your athlete to violate the rules and risk their eligibility.

**What to do:** Remove any references to school branding. Make sure the contract explicitly acknowledges that the athlete will not use school IP in NIL activities.

## Red Flag #7: Unreasonable Payment Terms

**What it looks like:** "Company will pay Athlete within 120 days of content delivery" or "Payment will be made in Company product/store credit."

**Why it's a problem:** Long payment terms mean your athlete does the work now but waits months to get paid. Payment in product only (rather than cash) should be clearly agreed to upfront — and the value should be fair.

**What to do:** Negotiate payment terms of 30 days or less. If any compensation is in product, make sure it's clearly stated and that the total value is fair for the work being done. Cash should be the primary form of compensation for most deals.

## Red Flag #8: One-Sided Morality Clauses

**What it looks like:** "Company may terminate this agreement immediately if Athlete engages in any conduct that, in Company's sole discretion, brings disrepute to Company."

**Why it's a problem:** "Sole discretion" morality clauses give the company unlimited power to end the deal for any reason and label it a morality violation. Your athlete could be terminated for a social media post the company simply doesn't like, with no recourse.

**What to do:** If a morality clause is included, ensure it's mutual (applies to both parties), specific (defines what conduct would trigger it), and requires reasonable notice. Your athlete shouldn't be penalized for normal teenage behavior.

## Red Flag #9: No Minor Protections

**What it looks like:** A contract that makes no mention of the athlete's age, parental consent, or applicable minor protection laws.

**Why it's a problem:** Contracts with minors are subject to special rules in most states. A contract that ignores this could be unenforceable — or worse, it could expose your athlete to risks that minor protection laws are designed to prevent.

**What to do:** Ensure the contract acknowledges the athlete is a minor, requires parental or guardian consent, complies with your state's laws regarding contracts with minors, and includes provisions for a parent or guardian to act on the athlete's behalf.

## What a Good NIL Contract Looks Like

A good NIL contract should include:

**Clear identification of parties** — the athlete (with parent/guardian as co-signer for minors) and the company.

**Specific scope of work** — exactly what deliverables are expected, including quantity, format, and timeline.

**Defined compensation** — how much the athlete will be paid, in what form, and when.

**Limited, specific image rights** — clearly defined uses of the athlete's NIL, limited to the contract term.

**Reasonable term length** — 3-6 months for most high school athletes, with options to renew if both parties agree.

**Mutual termination rights** — both parties can end the agreement with reasonable notice.

**Content approval** — the athlete has the right to review and approve content before publication.

**Compliance language** — the contract acknowledges applicable state NIL rules and athletic association guidelines.

**Minor protections** — appropriate provisions for athletes under 18.

## Conclusion

NIL contracts should empower your athlete, not trap them. Taking the time to carefully review every contract — and flagging any red flags before signing — protects your athlete's eligibility, reputation, and future opportunities.

When in doubt, consult with an attorney who understands NIL and athlete contracts. The cost of a legal review is minimal compared to the cost of a bad deal.

    content: `In the NIL era, a high school athlete's personal brand isn't just a nice-to-have — it's the foundation for every NIL opportunity, college recruitment advantage, and career path beyond sports. But building a personal brand as a teenager can feel overwhelming. Where do you start? What should you post? How do you stand out?

This guide provides practical, actionable advice for high school athletes and their parents on building an authentic personal brand from scratch.

## Why Personal Branding Matters

A personal brand is how people perceive you when they encounter your name, face, or content online. For high school athletes, a strong personal brand serves multiple purposes.

**NIL opportunities.** Brands partner with athletes who have engaged audiences and clear identities. A strong personal brand is essentially your resume for NIL deals.

**College recruitment.** College coaches look at athletes' social media presence. A professional, well-managed brand can make a positive impression — while a neglected or inappropriate one can hurt your chances.

**Life skills.** Building a brand teaches marketing, communication, entrepreneurship, and self-awareness. These skills are valuable regardless of where your athletic career takes you.

**Post-athletic career.** Athletic careers don't last forever. The personal brand and audience you build as a high school athlete can support a career in coaching, media, business, or any field you choose.

Even if your state currently prohibits NIL, building your brand now means you'll be ready to monetize the moment the rules change or you enter college.

## Defining Your Brand Identity

Before you post anything, take time to define what your brand is about. This is the foundation that everything else builds on.

**Start with your values.** What do you stand for? Hard work? Community service? Faith? Family? Your values should come through in everything you share.

**Identify what makes you unique.** What sets you apart from every other athlete in your sport? Maybe it's your training philosophy, your comeback story, your personality, your academic achievements, or your interests outside of sports.

**Define your audience.** Who do you want to reach? Other athletes? Parents? Fans in your community? Local businesses? Understanding your audience helps you create content that resonates.

**Create your brand statement.** In one sentence, describe who you are and what you're about. For example: "A three-sport athlete from rural Texas who believes hard work and education unlock every door." This statement guides your content and partnerships.

**Choose your visual identity.** Pick 2-3 colors that represent your brand. Use a consistent profile photo across platforms. If possible, have professional headshots taken. Visual consistency makes you instantly recognizable.

## Choosing the Right Platforms

You don't need to be on every platform. Focus your energy where it matters most.

**Instagram** is ideal for polished photos, stories, reels, and carousel posts. It's the most established platform for athlete branding and NIL deals. Brands are comfortable evaluating athletes on Instagram because the metrics are well-understood.

**TikTok** offers the best organic reach for new creators. Short-form video content can go viral and grow your audience quickly. TikTok is especially powerful for showing personality, humor, and behind-the-scenes content.

**YouTube** is best for longer content like vlogs, training videos, and in-depth storytelling. It's harder to grow on YouTube, but the audience tends to be more engaged and loyal. YouTube also generates ad revenue once you meet the monetization threshold.

**X (Twitter)** is useful for commentary, connecting with media, and engaging in sports conversations. It's less visual but can help establish thought leadership.

For most high school athletes, starting with Instagram and TikTok and doing both well is better than spreading yourself thin across five platforms.

## Creating a Content Strategy

Posting randomly won't build a brand. You need a strategy.

**The 80/20 rule.** Roughly 80% of your content should provide value (entertainment, inspiration, education, behind-the-scenes) and 20% can be promotional (sponsored content, calls to action).

**Content pillars.** Choose 3-4 themes that define your content. For example: training and workouts, game day highlights, daily life and personality, and community involvement. Every post should fit one of these pillars.

**Post consistently.** Aim for 4-5 posts per week across your platforms. Consistency is more important than perfection. Use a content calendar to plan ahead.

**Mix your content formats.** Use a variety of formats: photos, short videos, stories, reels, carousels, and long-form videos. Different formats reach different segments of your audience.

**Show your personality.** The most successful athlete brands feel authentic and personal. Don't be afraid to show humor, vulnerability, and your life outside of sports. People follow people, not highlight reels.

**Use trending sounds and formats.** On TikTok and Instagram Reels, using trending audio and formats can dramatically increase your reach. Put your own athletic spin on popular trends.

## Growing Your Audience

Building an audience takes time, but these strategies can accelerate growth.

**Engage with your community.** Reply to every comment and DM, especially when you're starting out. Engagement signals to algorithms that your content is worth showing to more people.

**Collaborate with other athletes.** Create content with teammates, rivals, or athletes in different sports. Cross-promotion introduces you to new audiences.

**Use location tags and hashtags.** Tag your city, school area, and sport in every post. Use a mix of broad hashtags (#HighSchoolFootball) and specific ones (#TexasHSFootball).

**Share your story.** People connect with narrative. Share milestones, setbacks, and moments that define your journey. Stories are more shareable than highlight clips.

**Be part of conversations.** Comment on posts from larger athletes, brands, and sports accounts. Thoughtful comments can drive profile visits and followers.

**Create shareable content.** Think about what would make someone share your post with a friend. Inspirational quotes over training footage, impressive highlights, funny moments, and useful tips all tend to be shared.

## Building a Community

Growing followers is one thing. Building a community of people who genuinely care about your journey is another — and it's far more valuable.

**Respond to your audience.** Take time to reply to comments and messages. A personal response turns a casual follower into a loyal fan.

**Ask questions.** Use polls, Q&A features, and open-ended captions to invite your audience to participate. People invest in brands they feel part of.

**Celebrate your community.** Shout out fans, supporters, and teammates. Feature user-generated content when people tag you.

**Be consistent and reliable.** Show up regularly. Your audience should know what to expect from you and trust that you'll deliver.

## Protecting Your Brand

As your brand grows, protecting it becomes important.

**Think before you post.** Every post is permanent, even if you delete it. Screenshots last forever. If you wouldn't want a college coach, future employer, or brand partner to see it, don't post it.

**Avoid controversy.** Stay out of political arguments, online drama, and negative content. Your brand should be a safe space for sponsors.

**Monitor your mentions.** Keep an eye on what people are saying about you online. Address any misinformation or negative content proactively.

**Be careful with endorsements.** Even before you have formal NIL deals, be thoughtful about what products and brands you associate with on social media. Your endorsement is your reputation.

**Secure your accounts.** Use strong passwords, enable two-factor authentication, and never share login credentials.

## The Parent's Role

Parents play a crucial role in a young athlete's brand-building journey.

**Be supportive, not controlling.** Guide your athlete's content strategy, but let their authentic voice come through. Overly polished, parent-managed accounts feel inauthentic.

**Review content before posting.** Especially for younger athletes, a quick parental review can catch potential issues before they go live.

**Manage the business side.** Handle contracts, finances, and communications with brands so your athlete can focus on creating content and competing.

**Protect their time.** Make sure brand-building doesn't take over your athlete's life. Academics and athletics should always come first.

**Educate yourself.** Understand the platforms your athlete uses, the NIL rules in your state, and the basics of digital marketing. The more you know, the better you can support them.

## Conclusion

Building a personal brand is one of the most valuable investments a high school athlete can make. It opens doors for NIL opportunities, impresses college recruiters, and develops skills that last a lifetime.

Start small, be authentic, stay consistent, and remember that every big brand started with zero followers. Your athlete's journey is their most powerful content.`,

    content: `Nutrition is the foundation of athletic performance. For high school athletes, what you eat directly impacts how you train, compete, recover, and grow. Yet nutrition is one of the most overlooked aspects of high school sports.

This guide provides a practical, science-based approach to nutrition and supplements for high school athletes and the parents who feed them.

## Nutrition Foundations for Athletes

Before diving into specific strategies, let's establish the basics. High school athletes have unique nutritional needs compared to their non-athletic peers.

**Higher calorie needs.** Active high school athletes may need 2,500 to 4,000+ calories per day depending on their sport, body size, and training volume. This is significantly more than the standard recommendation for teenagers.

**Nutrient timing matters.** When you eat is almost as important as what you eat. Fueling before training, during competition, and after workouts can dramatically affect performance and recovery.

**Growth and development.** High school athletes are still growing. Their nutrition needs to support both athletic performance and healthy physical development. Extreme diets or severe calorie restriction can be harmful during this critical period.

**Individual variation.** There's no one-size-fits-all nutrition plan. A 200-pound lineman has very different needs than a 120-pound distance runner. Use these guidelines as a starting point and adjust based on your athlete's needs, preferences, and results.

## Understanding Macronutrients

Macronutrients — carbohydrates, protein, and fats — are the building blocks of an athlete's diet.

**Carbohydrates are fuel.** Carbs are the primary energy source for high-intensity exercise. Athletes should get 45-65% of their calories from carbohydrates. Good sources include whole grains (brown rice, oats, whole wheat pasta), fruits, vegetables, beans, and potatoes.

Many athletes fear carbs because of diet culture trends, but for active athletes, carbohydrates are essential. Low-carb diets can impair athletic performance, especially in high-intensity sports.

**Protein builds and repairs.** Protein is essential for muscle growth, repair, and recovery. Athletes should aim for 1.2-2.0 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight per day. Good sources include lean meats, fish, eggs, dairy, beans, and tofu.

Spreading protein intake throughout the day (20-40 grams per meal) is more effective than consuming large amounts in a single sitting. The body can only use a certain amount of protein at one time for muscle synthesis.

**Fats support overall health.** Healthy fats are important for hormone production, joint health, and nutrient absorption. Athletes should get 20-35% of their calories from fat. Focus on healthy sources like nuts, avocados, olive oil, fatty fish, and seeds. Limit saturated and trans fats.

## Hydration Strategies

Dehydration is one of the most common and preventable performance killers in high school sports.

**Baseline hydration.** Athletes should drink water throughout the day, not just during practice. A good starting point is half your body weight in ounces. A 160-pound athlete should aim for about 80 ounces of water daily, more on training days.

**During exercise.** Drink 7-10 ounces of water every 10-20 minutes during exercise. For activities lasting more than 60 minutes, a sports drink with electrolytes and carbohydrates can help maintain performance.

**Signs of dehydration.** Dark urine, headache, fatigue, dizziness, and muscle cramps are all signs of dehydration. By the time you feel thirsty, you're already mildly dehydrated.

**Post-exercise.** Rehydrate with 16-24 ounces of fluid for every pound of body weight lost during exercise. Weigh yourself before and after practice to estimate fluid losses.

**Electrolytes matter.** Sodium, potassium, magnesium, and calcium are lost through sweat. For heavy sweaters or athletes in hot climates, electrolyte supplementation can be beneficial. Sports drinks, electrolyte tablets, or even simply adding a pinch of salt to water can help.

## Pre-Game and Pre-Practice Nutrition

What you eat before competition can make or break your performance.

**2-3 hours before:** Eat a balanced meal with carbohydrates, moderate protein, and low fat. Examples include chicken with rice and vegetables, a turkey sandwich on whole wheat, or pasta with lean meat sauce.

**30-60 minutes before:** Have a small, easily digestible snack that's carb-focused. Examples include a banana, a granola bar, toast with honey, or a small smoothie.

**Foods to avoid before competition:** High-fat foods (they digest slowly), high-fiber foods (they can cause GI distress), new or unfamiliar foods (practice your pre-game meal during training), and large meals too close to game time.

**Experiment during practice, not on game day.** Find what works for your body during training sessions, then stick to that routine for competition.

## Post-Workout Recovery Nutrition

The 30-60 minutes after intense exercise is a critical window for recovery.

**The recovery goal.** Replenish glycogen (energy) stores, provide protein for muscle repair, and rehydrate.

**The ideal post-workout meal or snack** includes both carbohydrates and protein in a roughly 3:1 ratio. Examples include chocolate milk (seriously — it's an excellent recovery drink), a protein smoothie with fruit, Greek yogurt with granola and berries, or a turkey and cheese sandwich.

**Timing matters.** Try to eat within 30-60 minutes after intense training. This is when your muscles are most receptive to nutrient uptake.

**Don't skip recovery nutrition.** Even if you're not hungry after a tough workout, your body needs fuel to recover. Force yourself to have at least a snack. Poor recovery nutrition leads to slower adaptation, increased soreness, and higher injury risk.

## Supplements: What Works and What Doesn't

The supplement industry markets aggressively to young athletes, but most supplements are unnecessary, ineffective, or potentially harmful. Here's what the science actually says.

**Supplements that may be beneficial:**

Protein powder is a convenient way to meet protein needs, but it's not superior to whole food sources. Whey protein is the most studied and effective option. Look for products tested by third-party organizations like NSF Certified for Sport or Informed Sport.

Creatine monohydrate is one of the most researched and effective supplements for improving strength and power. However, its use in athletes under 18 is debated. Consult with a sports medicine physician before use. If approved, use only creatine monohydrate — not "designer" creatine products.

Vitamin D is important for bone health, immune function, and athletic performance. Many athletes are deficient, especially those in northern climates or who train indoors. A blood test can determine if supplementation is needed.

**Supplements to avoid:**

Pre-workout supplements often contain high doses of caffeine, artificial stimulants, and unregulated ingredients that can be dangerous for developing bodies. Skip these entirely.

Testosterone boosters, growth hormone supplements, and similar products marketed for muscle building are not effective, may be harmful, and could contain banned substances that jeopardize eligibility.

Weight loss supplements and fat burners are inappropriate for high school athletes and can be harmful to growing bodies.

**The bottom line on supplements:** A well-planned diet provides everything most high school athletes need. Supplements should supplement a good diet, not replace one. Always consult with a healthcare provider before starting any supplement.

## Practical Meal Planning Tips

Knowing what to eat is one thing. Actually doing it consistently is another. Here are practical tips for busy families.

**Meal prep on weekends.** Spend a few hours on Sunday preparing proteins (grilled chicken, hard-boiled eggs), grains (rice, pasta), and vegetables for the week. This makes assembling meals during the busy week much easier.

**Keep healthy snacks accessible.** Stock the kitchen, car, and gym bag with portable snacks: trail mix, protein bars, fruit, cheese sticks, and peanut butter sandwiches.

**Don't skip breakfast.** Athletes who skip breakfast perform worse in morning practices and school. Even a quick option like overnight oats, a smoothie, or toast with peanut butter and banana is better than nothing.

**Plan around practice schedules.** If practice is right after school, make sure your athlete has a substantial lunch and an after-school snack. If practice is in the evening, plan dinner timing accordingly.

**Make it enjoyable.** Nutrition shouldn't feel like punishment. Include foods your athlete enjoys. Find healthy versions of their favorites. The best nutrition plan is one they'll actually follow.

## Common Nutrition Mistakes

**Skipping meals.** Busy student-athletes often skip meals, especially breakfast. This leads to low energy, poor performance, and overeating later. Make eating a priority.

**Not eating enough.** Many athletes undereat, especially in sports with weight classes or aesthetic components. Chronic under-fueling impairs performance, increases injury risk, and can affect growth and development.

**Relying on fast food.** While an occasional fast food meal won't derail your nutrition, relying on it regularly means missing out on the nutrient density that whole foods provide.

**Fad diets.** Keto, intermittent fasting, and other restrictive diets are generally not appropriate for growing athletes. These diets can deprive young bodies of the energy and nutrients they need.

**Overthinking it.** Nutrition doesn't need to be complicated. Focus on eating enough whole foods, staying hydrated, and timing your nutrition around training. Don't stress about being perfect.

## Conclusion

Good nutrition is the easiest competitive advantage available to high school athletes. You don't need expensive supplements or complicated meal plans. You need consistent, balanced meals built around whole foods, proper hydration, and smart timing around training.

Work with your athlete to develop eating habits that support their performance today and their health for a lifetime. If you need personalized guidance, consider consulting with a registered dietitian who specializes in sports nutrition.
